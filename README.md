# Hello EA Pulse Team

* Here's my work. This was a bit of challenge for me as I've been ensconsed in backbone world for the past month, but the ideas are the same -- separation of concerns, keep business logic in the service and make sure your methods are testable. To be honest though, some of my tests are less than wonderful and complete, but I'm pretty raw when it comes to writing angular tests. As stated in the interview though, I have no problem with the idea of writing tests and 100% am comitted to the rationale behind it. I'll just have to figure out how to write effective angular.js tests. I'm willing to put in extra time to learn how to do this and am hoping you are willing to work with me some too. Thanks for your time and all the best in your search for a great dev -- which I believe is me :)

### Love, Cameron
